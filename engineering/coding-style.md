# Coding Style

## Background

Bad coding style introduces/propagates errors, increases global cost, and
decreases readability. This article means to communicate best practices.

Also, this article was somewhat inspired by some sentense seen from javadoc:

<pre>
In java, the local-sensitive classes provide a class method, getInstace, for
getting a generally useful object of the type, for example,
java.util.Calendar.getInstance returns a Calendar object whose calendar fields
have been initialized with the current date and time.
</pre>
